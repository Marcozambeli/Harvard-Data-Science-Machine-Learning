Key points
Random forests are a very popular machine learning approach that addresses the shortcomings of decision trees. The goal is to improve prediction performance and reduce instability by averaging multiple decision trees (a forest of trees constructed with randomness).
The general idea of random forests is to generate many predictors, each using regression or classification trees, and then forming a final prediction based on the average prediction of all these trees. To assure that the individual trees are not the same, we use the bootstrap to induce randomness. 
A disadvantage of random forests is that we lose interpretability.
An approach that helps with interpretability is to examine variable importance. To define variable importance we count how often a predictor is used in the individual trees. The caret package includes the function varImp that extracts variable importance from any model in which the calculation is implemented. 
Code
library(randomForest)
fit <- randomForest(margin~., data = polls_2008) 
plot(fit)

polls_2008 %>%
  mutate(y_hat = predict(fit, newdata = polls_2008)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_line(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")

library(randomForest)
train_rf <- randomForest(y ~ ., data=mnist_27$train)
confusionMatrix(predict(train_rf, mnist_27$test), mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]

# use cross validation to choose parameter
train_rf_2 <- train(y ~ .,
      method = "Rborist",
      tuneGrid = data.frame(predFixed = 2, minNode = c(3, 50)),
      data = mnist_27$train)
confusionMatrix(predict(train_rf_2, mnist_27$test), mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
